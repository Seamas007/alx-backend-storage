Learning Objectives
Learn how to use redis for basic operations
Learn how to use redis as a simple cache
Requirements
All of your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All of your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions and methods should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
